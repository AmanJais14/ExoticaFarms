              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Agricultural real estate investment has emerged as one of the most stable and profitable investment 
                opportunities in India. With growing population, increasing food demand, and limited arable land, 
                farmland values have consistently appreciated over the past decade. Our exotic farming approach 
                combines traditional agriculture with modern techniques to deliver exceptional returns.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Understanding Exotic Farming Returns</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Exotic farming focuses on high-value crops that command premium prices in both domestic and 
                international markets. Unlike traditional farming, exotic crops like dragon fruit, avocados, 
                and specialty herbs can generate 3-5x higher returns per acre. Our scientific approach ensures 
                optimal yield and quality, translating to consistent 12-18% annual dividends for investors.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Investment Process & Due Diligence</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Our investment process follows strict due diligence protocols. Each farmland parcel undergoes 
                comprehensive soil testing, water availability assessment, and market analysis. We provide 
                complete transparency with regular updates, financial reports, and on-site visits for investors.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Risk Management & Insurance</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Agricultural investments carry inherent risks including weather, market fluctuations, and crop 
                diseases. We mitigate these through crop insurance, diversified planting, and professional 
                farm management. Our experienced team has successfully managed agricultural operations for over 
                a decade, ensuring consistent returns even during challenging seasons.
